# Krita Extension - Image Pixelizer
There are 2 directories in this project, we will use the `lib/` directory for working on 
the image processing part of our project for testing and the `krita/` directory for creating the krita extension. Please use the `krita/deploy_extension.sh` script to deploy your code changes to krita (that must be run from the `krita` directory).
